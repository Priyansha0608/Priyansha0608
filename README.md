# Hello! I'm Priyansha, and I am a 3rd year CS student @ UC Irvine. 

My goal is to work on diverse programming projects, so I can figure out where my interests lie. During Winter 2022 and Spring 2022, I worked on the **Wireless Endoscope Research Project** with Dr. Mao through CALIT2 at UCI.

Here's also [my UCI Hacks ZotHacks 2021 submission](https://devpost.com/software/zotboard) to DevPost, where I built ZotBoard, an online whiteboard.
